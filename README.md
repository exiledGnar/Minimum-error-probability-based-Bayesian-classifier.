# Minimum-error-probability-based-Bayesian-classifier.
Coded with Matlab2021a/Using a large dataset of height and weight data for both males and females, classify the input data using the minimum error rate Bayesian estimation.
By running part1, part2, part3, part4, and part5 consecutively, you can complete the prediction.
The file part2.1 and similar files are code files required for completing other tasks.
"Dataload.m" is used to load the data.
"Gender_selection" is used to separate males and females into two matrices.
"Dele_error" and "Dele_error1" are used to delete outliers in the data.
"histogram_draw" is used to plot the histogram of the data.
"fitdist_est" is used for maximum likelihood estimation.
"relationship1" is used to calculate the correlation between height and weight.
"normalization1" is used for data normalization.
"Bayesian_est" and "Bayesian_est2" are used for prediction, where "Bayesian_est2" is an improved method.
